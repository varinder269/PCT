# Plagiarism_checker_tool

Plagriasim checking is one of the classic example of edit distance problems= of string. where we have ot match 2 strings in linear time. 

The edit distance between two strings is a measure of similarity. For strings X and Y, the edit distance ED(X,Y) is defined as the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform X into Y. Problems such as (i) finding edit distance and (ii) determining whether the edit distance is greater than a given threshold are of fundamental importance. Applications of their solutions include plagiarism detection and genomic DNA sequence alignment. This project focuses on the study of algorithms to solve edit distance problems.

This tool is made using tkinter. 
made an interface that takes two PDF files as input and converts them to text files and displays results as Plagiarism
percentage and Levenshtein Distance.
